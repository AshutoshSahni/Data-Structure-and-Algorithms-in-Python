# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-in-Python

This Github repository includes the implementation of Data Structure and Algorithms in Python. **Currently I am learning DSA** and also trying to maintain this repository.

Apart from implementation, I have also **included the details about Space and Time Complexity** of each Data Structure and Algorithm with a brief explaination.

Topics covered so far:

**Algorithms**
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
3. Shell Sort
