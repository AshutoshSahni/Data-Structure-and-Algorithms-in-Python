# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-in-Python

This Github directory includes the implementation of Data Structure and Algorithms in Python. **Currently I am learning DSA** and also trying to maintain this repository.

Apart from implementation, I am also **including the details about Space and Time Complexity** of each Data Structure and Algorithm with a brief explaination about working of topic.

So far topics covered :

**Algorithms**
1. Linear Search
